        <p>I am currently working in a customer service position at a local grocery store. I have just started learning HTML and CSS, and find it fun and challenging. I have gained a much deeper appreciation for good website design after seeing how much work goes into it.</p>
        <p>I enjoy playing video games and arts and crafts, mainly for the progress that you can see by the end of it. It is very fulfilling looking back after spending some time on something and being able to see how much has changed since the start.</p>
